          <li><strong>1981</strong> - He was a proponent of Bangladesh and democracy. He was elected to lead the Awami League party in February. Unfortunately, his unpopular behaviour kept him under house arrest or imprisonment for almost a decade</li>

          <li><strong>1981</strong> - Awami League President and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina returned to Bangladesh from India, nearly six years after the assassination of her father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</li>

          <li><strong>2001</strong> - The Awami League (AL), with other opposition parties, demanded that the next general elections be held under a neutral caretaker government, and that provision for caretaker governments to manage elections be incorporated in the constitution. The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) refused to act on these demands.[32]</li>
          <li><strong>2008</strong> - The Awami League MPs were irregular in attending the Parliament during the following period.[39] In late 2003, the Awami League started its first major anti-government movement, culminating in the declaration by party general secretary Abdul Jolil that the government would fall before 30 April 2004. This failed to happen and was seen as a blow to the party and Hasina, who had implicitly supported Jalil.</li>

          <li><strong>2019</strong> - Hasina won her third consecutive term, her fourth overall, when her Bangladesh Awami League won 288 of the 300 parliamentary seats. The leader of the main Opposition party, Kamal Hossain, declared the vote "farcical" and rejected the results.

          <li><strong>2021</strong> - Sheikh Hasina said the bridge would be opened to traffic </li>
